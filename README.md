1. User data is stored in local storage. So, that user  can     continue from where he or she left off. 
2. User donations are shown in a pie-chart. Meaning full message shown when donated.
3. Dynamically, data is shown from a JSON file. The Donations Details page shows only 4 cards if there's more than 4 cards. You can see all donations by clicking the See All button.
